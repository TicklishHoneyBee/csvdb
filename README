ABOUT:
csvdb is an SQL engine for csv (character separated values) files,
 allowing files to be searched as if they were database tables

DEPENDENCIES:
csvdb requires the standard C and POSIX libraries, and optionally the
 readline and gettext libraries. It has been tested with glibc and may
 work with other C libraries.

INSTALL:
If you're reading this then you've already unpacked the tarball,
so it's the usual steps:
1) cd /path/to/csvdb
1a) if downloading the development source from git, run `autoreconf -i'
 to generate a configure file
2) ./configure
3) make
4) su -
5) make install

UNINSTALL:
just cd to the csvdb directory and run "make uninstall"

USE:
csvdb [-f <file>] [-a <file>] [-n <alias>] [-e <query>]
	If no -e query is given on the command line, the csvdb
	 interactive shell will open
	See http://sandbox.ltmnet.com/csvdb-doc.html or `man csvdb' for
	 details on the sql currently supported by csvdb

LICENSE:
csvdb is licensed under the GPLv3, there's a copy of it in LICENSE

DEVELOPMENT:
I might do more to it, if so I'll let everyone know through
 sandbox.ltmnet.com/csvdb
If you make any changes, let me know: lisa@ltmnet.com
