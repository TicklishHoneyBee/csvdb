ABOUT:
csvdb is an SQL engine for csv (comma separated values) files, allowing
 files to be searched as if they were database tables

DEPENDENCIES:
csvdb requires the standard C and POSIX libraries. It has been tested
 with glibc and may work with other C libraries, but this has not been
 tested.

INSTALL:
If you're reading this then you've already unpacked the tarball,
so it's the usual 5 steps:
1) cd /path/to/csvdb
2) ./configure --with-readline
3) make
4) su -
5) make install

UNINSTALL:
just cd to the csvdb directory and run "make uninstall"

USE:
csvdb [-f <file>] [-a <file>] [-n <alias>] [-e <query>]
	If no -e query is given on the command line, the csvdb
	 interactive shell will open
	See http://sandbox.ltmnet.com/csvdb-doc.html or `man csvdb'
	 for details on the sql currently supported by csvdb

LICENSE:
csvdb is licensed under the GPLv3, there's a copy of it in LICENSE

DEVELOPMENT:
I might do more to it, if so I'll let everyone know through
 sandbox.ltmnet.com/csvdb
